# My Slideshow Template 1

This is a template that I use for delivering Web based presentations.

It is using the nice `reveal-md` tool that improves considerably the authoring experience. Just a couple of markdown rules and that's it. You get enough for a pleasant result.

<br/>

## Prereqs

These are basically `reveal-md` prerequisites. You need to have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) (using `npm install -g reveal-md`)

<br/>

## Usage

Use `./show.sh` for having the result open in a browser and automatically reloaded on content changes.

Start writing on `slides.md` file and enjoy the experience!

`print.sh` could be used for generating the PDF version of the slides. Look into it for updating some variables before usage. This usage will be improved. Currently, `print` directory includes the generated output as an example.
